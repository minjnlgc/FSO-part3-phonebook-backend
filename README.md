# Full Stack Open - Part 3

This repository contains my solutions for Part 3 of the [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part3/) course.

## Description

The `main` and `phonebook` branches contain the exercise `phonebook`. A separate repository was used, since _ want to deploy it through Render.

The `note` branch is coded follow the example provided in the course.

## Deployment

You can find the deployed version of the `phonebook` exercise [here](https://part3-phonebook-backend-0y1x.onrender.com).
